## 🎯 Current Architecture

### Before (2-Model Simple)
```
User Request
    ↓
Task Analysis
    ↓
Model Router → Select model
    ↓
Execute (single phase)
    ↓
Return result
```

**Problems:**
- No context gathering
- No verification
- No retry mechanism
- ~70% success rate

### After (OpenThinker-First + Verification)
```
User Request
    ↓
GATHER CONTEXT (OpenThinker + bash tools)
  - Search relevant files
  - Analyze project structure
  - Find code patterns
    ↓
PLAN (OpenThinker with context)
  - Create detailed implementation plan
  - Decide on approach
    ↓
EXECUTE (Qwen following plan)
  - Generate tool calls
  - Write/edit files
    ↓
VERIFY (OpenThinker checks work)
  - File exists?
  - Syntax valid?
  - Matches plan?
    ↓
IF FAILED → RETRY (OpenThinker → Qwen loop)
    ↓
Return verified result
```

**Improvements:**
- ✓ Context-aware decisions
- ✓ Verification catches errors
- ✓ Automatic retry on failure
- ✓ ~95% success rate (target)
- ✓ 10-20x faster model swaps

## 📊 Performance Targets

### Model Swap Speed
- **Before**: Disk load ~5-8s
- **After**: RAM load ~500ms (10-20x faster!)

### Success Rate
- **Before**: ~70% (no verification)
- **After**: ~95% (with verify + retry)

### Overall Speed
- **Simple tasks**: 5-8s → **4-6s** (20-30% faster)
- **Complex tasks**: 30-60s → **15-25s** (50% faster)
- **Model swaps**: 12-17s → **2s** (6-8x faster)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Integrate new tools into agent.py
2. Implement context → execute → verify flow
3. Add RAM preloading on startup
4. Test with sample tasks

### Short-term (This Week)
5. Add retry/reapply mechanism
6. Implement checkpointing
7. Add hooks system
8. Optimize prompts for caching

### Long-term (Future)
9. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
10. Multi-agent delegation
11. Background task management
12. Advanced diff viewing

## 🎯 Testing Plan

### Test 1: Context Gathering
```python
context = context_gatherer.gather_for_task("Create a React dashboard")
# Should find: React files, package.json, component patterns
```

### Test 2: Verification
```python
result = fs_tools.write_file("test.py", "print('hello')")
verification = verifier.verify_action("write_file", {...}, result)
# Should: Check file exists, syntax valid
```

### Test 3: Model Swapping
```python
# Startup
model_manager.startup_preload()  # ~8-10s one-time

# Swap 1
model_manager.smart_load_for_phase('context')    # OpenThinker: ~500ms
model_manager.smart_load_for_phase('execution')  # Qwen: ~500ms
model_manager.smart_load_for_phase('verification')  # OpenThinker: ~500ms
# Total: ~1.5s for 3 swaps (vs 15-24s before!)
```

### Test 4: Full Workflow
```python
response = agent.chat("Create a modern landing page")

# Should execute:
# 1. Gather context (check for HTML/CSS files)
# 2. Plan with OpenThinker
# 3. Execute with Qwen
# 4. Verify with OpenThinker
# 5. Retry if needed
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Context IS Key (Claude Code Pattern)
- Use grep/find instead of loading all files
- Let OpenThinker decide what context is needed
- Cache context in 32GB RAM

### 2. Verification Prevents Failures
- Check every action immediately
- Catch errors before they compound
- Provide specific fix suggestions

### 3. RAM Preloading = Game Changer
- 32GB RAM can hold all 3 models
- Model swaps: 5-8s → 500ms
- Makes multi-model workflow practical

### 4. OpenThinker-First Works Better
- Better at understanding context
- Excellent verification reasoning
- Creative problem solving
- User prefers it!
