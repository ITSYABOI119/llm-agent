# Implementation Phase Plan - Quick Reference

## 📍 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

---

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement core Cursor/Claude Code patterns

**Completed:**
- ✅ RAM preloading for fast model swaps (10-20x speedup)
- ✅ Context gathering with bash tools (grep, find)
- ✅ Action verification system
- ✅ Gather → execute → verify → repeat loop
- ✅ OpenThinker-first architecture
- ✅ Basic retry mechanism

**Time:** ~4 hours
**Files:** 3 new tools, 5 docs, 1 test script

---

## Phase 2: Reliability 🔴 CRITICAL (Next)

**Goal:** Handle context limits and improve execution reliability

**Tasks:**
1. **Token Counting & Context Compression** (CRITICAL)
   - Implement token counter
   - Add context compression between phases
   - Prevent 8K context window overflow
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours

2. **Structured JSON Plans** (CRITICAL)
   - Generate JSON plans instead of freeform text
   - Explicit tool calls for Qwen
   - Validation before execution
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours

3. **Context Window Management**
   - Track token usage per phase
   - Prune context between phases
   - Smart summarization
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

**Why Critical:**
- Current system will fail on complex tasks (context overflow)
- Qwen may not follow freeform plans reliably
- These fixes prevent 80% of potential failures

**Expected Results After Phase 2:**
- Success rate: 80-85% → **90-95%**
- Can handle large multi-file projects
- More reliable execution

**Total Time:** 5-8 hours

   - Use appropriate model for failure type
   - Better prompting for retries

3. **Parallel Execution** (2-3 hours)
   - Generate next file while verifying previous
   - Optimize model swap timing
   - Reduce total execution time

**Expected Results:**
- Average time: 15-25s → **12-18s**
- Complex tasks: 30-60s → **20-40s**
- Faster failure recovery

**Total Time:** 5-8 hours

   - Show what changed
   - Interactive restore

**Expected Results:**
- Can undo any change
- Safe experimentation
- Better error recovery

**Total Time:** 6-9 hours

## Phase 5: Hooks System 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE

**Goal:** Auto-trigger actions after operations (Claude Code pattern)

**Tasks:**
1. **Hook Framework** (2-3 hours)
   - after_write hooks (auto-format, auto-lint)
   - after_edit hooks (validate, test)
   - before_execute hooks (backup, permissions)

2. **Built-in Hooks** (2-3 hours)
   - Auto-format code (black, prettier)
   - Auto-run linter
   - Auto-update imports

3. **Custom Hooks** (1-2 hours)
   - User-defined hooks in .claude/hooks/
   - Bash/Python script support
   - Hook configuration

**Expected Results:**
- Code auto-formatted after write
- Linting automatic
- Custom workflows possible

**Total Time:** 5-8 hours

---

## Phase 6: Comment Markers 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE

**Goal:** Use Cursor's apply model pattern for edits

**Tasks:**
1. **Update edit_file Method** (2-3 hours)
   - Use `# ...` for unchanged code
   - Show only changes explicitly
   - Cursor's diff pattern

2. **Template Generation** (1-2 hours)
   - Generate edit templates
   - Smart diff detection
   - Language-specific comments

**Expected Results:**
- Clearer edit intentions
- Better LLM understanding
- Fewer edit mistakes

**Total Time:** 3-5 hours

---

## Phase 7: Prompt Optimization 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE

**Goal:** Enable prompt caching (Cursor optimization)

**Tasks:**
1. **Static System Prompts** (2-3 hours)
   - Separate static from dynamic content
   - Cache-friendly prompt structure
   - Reduce repeated tokens

2. **Dynamic Context Injection** (1-2 hours)
   - Inject only changing context
   - Minimize prompt changes
   - Maximize cache hits

3. **Cache Management** (1-2 hours)
   - Monitor cache hit rates
   - Optimize for Ollama caching
   - Tune prompt structure

**Expected Results:**
- Faster LLM responses (cache hits)
- Lower token usage
- Better cost efficiency

**Total Time:** 4-7 hours
