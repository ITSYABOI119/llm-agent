## How to Test

### Sequential Testing (Recommended)
Test in order from simple to complex:
```bash
python agent.py "prompt 1"
python agent.py "prompt 6"
python agent.py "prompt 13"
```

### Category Testing
Test one category at a time:
```bash
# Test simple tasks (should be fast, 0 swaps)
python agent.py "prompt 1"
python agent.py "prompt 2"
python agent.py "prompt 3"

# Test complex tasks (should use openthinker, 2.5s swap)
python agent.py "prompt 13"
python agent.py "prompt 14"
```

### Stress Testing
Run multiple prompts in succession:
```bash
python agent.py "prompt 35"
python agent.py "prompt 36"
python agent.py "prompt 37"
```

   - Standard tasks: <30s average
   - Complex tasks: <60s average (including 2.5s swap)

3. **Reliability**
   - All file edits succeed
   - Syntax validation works
   - Retries succeed with enhanced prompts
   - Diff edits apply correctly

4. **Quality**
   - Generated code is syntactically correct
   - Complex tasks show better planning
   - Error handling is present
   - Code follows best practices

---

## Troubleshooting

### If simple tasks are swapping:
- Check task_classifier.py - may be too conservative
- Review model_router.py - routing logic

### If retries aren't working:
- Check progressive_retry.py - retry logic
- Verify error detection in verifier.py

### If diff edits fail:
- Check diff_editor.py - line number handling
- Verify file exists and is readable

### If everything is slow:
- Check model_manager.py - swap times
- Verify Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Check if models are loaded: `ollama ps`

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to agent directory
cd llm-agent

# Test simple task (should be fast)
./venv/Scripts/python agent.py "Create a hello.py file with a print statement"

# Test standard task (should still be fast)
./venv/Scripts/python agent.py "Create a Calculator class with add and subtract methods"

# Test complex task (should use openthinker)
./venv/Scripts/python agent.py "Design a complete web scraper with threading and rate limiting"

# Test diff editor
./venv/Scripts/python agent.py "Replace function calculate in math_utils.py with a better implementation"

# Test retry
./venv/Scripts/python agent.py "Create a function with syntax: def broken(): missing body"
```

---

## Advanced Testing

### Monitor Swap Times
Watch the logs for swap time measurements:
```bash
tail -f logs/agent.log | grep -i "swap\|loading model"
```

### Track Task Classification
See how tasks are being classified:
```bash
tail -f logs/agent.log | grep -i "classified as"
```

### Monitor Retries
Watch for retry attempts:
```bash
tail -f logs/agent.log | grep -i "retry\|attempt"
```

---

## Final Validation

After running tests, verify:

1. ‚úÖ Simple tasks completed in <15s
2. ‚úÖ Most tasks used qwen only (check logs)
3. ‚úÖ Complex tasks used openthinker (check logs)
4. ‚úÖ File edits were successful and accurate
5. ‚úÖ Retries worked when needed
6. ‚úÖ No crashes or unhandled errors
7. ‚úÖ Generated code is syntactically correct
8. ‚úÖ Swap times measured accurately (~2.5s when swapping)

**If all checks pass: System is working perfectly! üéâ**
